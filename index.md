## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    All of lab 1 was a favorite of mine because it was the first lab of the year and the start of my
    journey as a programmer. For the first time I learned how to operate on linux, access vs code,
    and push code to git hub all in one day.

* Lab 6 part -2

    Lab 6 part 2 was a favorite of mine because out of all the labs we have done, so far this lab
    was the hardest one of the year. A big problem with this lab was me and my partner not knowing
    how to convert the card strings into integers, since the card names were the value of the card.
    We then found out about the code line, “std::stoi(card_name),” which converts strings into
    integers (e.g., "7" -> 7). Thanks to this lab pushing our minds we learned a new technique that
    we will definitely be using and remembering in the future of our programming career.

* Lab 8 part-1

    Lab 8 part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a lab that me and my partner understood
    and had fun with the whole time. It seemed that for that lab everything clicked for us, we knew
    that if it was a double that means it will have a decimal and understood how to use and write if
    and for loops without any outside sources.
